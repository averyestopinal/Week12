# Week12
Building a simple ML pipeline to predict wine cultivar (class) from wine dataset in SkLearn. Random forest classifier is the chosen model for this assignment. 10 estimators were used to predict in little time, but more can be used to enhance accuracy.

Accuracy of model is 91.1% with 10 estimators and 2nd degree polynomial features.

Knowledge and resources from AIPI503 were used on this assigment.

## How to run:
'''bash
git clone https://github.com/averyestopinal/Week12.git
cd Week12
pip install -r requirements.txt
python wine.py
